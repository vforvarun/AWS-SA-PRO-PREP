AWS Storage Options
  - S3
    - provides Developers and IT teams secure, durable, highly scalable, object storage at very low cost.
    - Any amount of data can be retrived from anywhere via the internet
    - A single object size is limited to 5TB
    - Highly scalable and allows concurrent read and write access to data by many separate clients or applications.
    - Storage Classes
      - S3 Standard: for general purpose storage of frequently used data
      - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access: for long-lived but less frequently used data
      - Glacier: for low-cost archival
    - Usage Patterns
      - Store and distribute static web content and media
        - Direct URL to files
        - Can serve as origin store for CDN such as CloudFront
        - Can handle demand spikes because of S3's elastic feature
        - no storage provisioning required and is best suit for high traffic websites and data intensive websites
      - S3 is used to store entire static websites
      - S3 is a data store for computation and large scale analytics.
      - Highly durable, scalable and secure solution for backup and archiving of critical data.
    - Anti Patterns: S3 doesn't suit all storage situations
      - Filesystem: Use EFS instead
      - Structured data with query: Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, CloudSearch
      - Rapidly changing data: EBS, EFS, DynomoDB, RDS
      - Archival Data: Glacier
      - Dynamic Website hosting: EC2, EFS
    Performance:
      - Speed
        - S3 to EC2 instance is designed to be very fast
        - Server-side latencies are insignificant compared to internet
      - Multi-part upload
        - To improve upload performance of large objects, multi-part upload option should be used.
        - S3 assembles all the parts after it receives it all.
        - Upload multiple parts in parallel. Retry Uploading smaller objects rather than entire object
      - Transfer Acceleration
        - S3 Transfer acceleration enables fast, easy and secure transfer of files over long distances.
        - Leverages global network of CDN, CloudFront over an optimized network path.
        - Enable on S3 bucket and then S3 PUT and GET requests should be modified to use S3-accelarate end point domain name (bucketname.s3.accelerate.amazonaws.com). Performance improvement seen in excess of 500%.
