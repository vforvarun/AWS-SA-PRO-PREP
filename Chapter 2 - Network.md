- Pre-requisites
    - Physical Layout of AZs and Regions
    - VPC Concept and how to create
    - Create private and public subnets
    - What a NAT is and what "Disable source/destination checks" mean
    - Route table and routing terminology (default routes, local routes)
    - IPv4 Addressing and Subnet Mask notation (/16, /24, etc)
    - Intermediate Networking Terminology (MAC Address, Port, Gateways vs Router)


- Concepts
    - OSI Model
      - 1. Physical -> Cat 5, Fiber Optic Cable, 5GZ -> Bits -> Please
      - 2. Data Link -> MAC Address -> Frame -> Do
      - 3. Network -> IP, ARP -> Packet -> Not
      - 4. Transport -> TCP -> Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) -> Throw
      - 5. Session -> Setup, Negotiation and Teardown -> Sausage
      - 6. Presentation -> TLS/SSL, Compression -> Pizza
      - 7. Application -> Web Browser -> Away
    - AWS doesn't allow multicast
      - Unicast: More like phone call. 1x1 conversation, no impact to anyone else on the line.
      - Multicast: Shouting over a mega phone to everyone. Network card sending packets to everyone.
    - TCP vs UDP vs ICMP
      - TCP
        - Connection-based, stateful, acknowledges receipt
        - Analogy: After everything I say, I want you to confirm that you received it.
        - Uses: Web, Email, File Transfer
      - UDP
        - Connectionless, stateless, simple, no retransmission delays
        - Analogy: I'm going start talking and its OK if you miss some words.
        - Uses: Streaming media, DNS.
      - ICMP
        - Generally by network devices to exchange info
        - We routers can talk to each other about network health in our own language.
        - traceroute, ping
      - Ephemeral Ports
        - Short-lived transport protocol ports used in IP communications
        - Above the "well known" IP Port (above 1024)
        - Also called as Dynamic Ports
        - Suggested range is 49152 to 65535 but
          - Linux Kernels generally use 32568 to 61000
          - Windows platforms default from 1025
        - There are some NACL and Security Group implications

      - Simple Communication Scenario:
        - Web Server on 192.168.1.2 waits for connections on Port 80
        - Client on 192.168.1.6 initiates a connection to port 80 for a HTTP Session
        - Server responds "Hello, this is Server"
        - Client says "Hi, I'm client 6. You can use port 56784 to sent back what I request"
        - Server responds "Ok, will do. Here's your webpage and I'll keep your session open"
        - Client Requests another webpage
        - Server responds "Hey, I know you, I'll send you the data over the existing session"

      - AWS Availability Zones
        - The Physical to Logical assignment of AZs is done at the Account level

      - Network to VPC Connectivity
        - AWS Managed VPN
          - What: AWS managed IPsec VPN Connection over existing Internet Connection
          - When: Quick and usually simple way to establish a secure tunneled connection to a VPC; Redundant link for Direct Connect or other VPC VPN
          - Pros: Supports static routes or BGP Peering and routing
          - Cons: Dependent on your Internet Connection
          - How to create:
            - On AWS side
              - Create Virtual Private Gateway and attach to desired VPC
              - Create Customer Gateway on AWS
              - Create VPN Connection, linking Virtual Private Gateway with Customer Gateway
              - Download Customer Gateway config
            - On Customer side
              - Configure router to connect to AWS VPN Connection
              - Configure BGP routing (if needed)
        - AWS Direct Connect
          - What: Dedicated network connection over private lines into AWS backbone
          - When: Require a "big pipe" into AWS; lots of resources and services being provided on AWS to corporate users
          - Pros
            - More predictable network performance
            - Potential bandwidth cost reduction
            - Up to 10GBps provisioned connections
            - Supports BGP Peering and routing
          - Cons: May require additional telcom and hosting provider relationships and/or new network circuits.
          - How:
            - Work with your existing Data Provider
            - Create Virtual Interfaces (VIF) to connect to VPCs (Private VIF) or other AWS service like S3 or Glacier (Public VIF).

        - AWS Direct Connect + VPN
        - AWS VPN CloudHub
        - Software VPN
        - Transit VPC
