*Architecting to Scale Module*

- Concepts
  - Architectural Patterns
    - Loosely Coupled Architecture (LCA)
      - Components can stand independently and require little or no knowledge of the inner workings of the other components.
      - Benefits of LCA
        - Layers of abstraction
        - Permits more flexibility
        - Interchangeable components
        - More atomic or isolated functional units
        - Can scale components independently
  - Types of Scaling
    - Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
      - Add more instances as demand increases
      - No downtime required to Scale Out of Scale in
      - Automatic using Auto-Scaling groups
      - Theoretically Unlimited on AWS
      - Cost Effective
    - Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
      - Add more CPU and/or RAM to existing instance as demand increases
      - Requires restart to scale up or down
      - Would require scripting to automate
      - Limited by instance sizes
  - Auto-Scaling Groups
    - Automatically provides horizontal scaling (scale-out) as required by the demand
    - Triggered by an event or scaling action to either launch or terminate instances
    - Availability, Cost and System metrics can all factor into scaling.
    - Four Scaling Options
      - Maintain
        - Keep a specific or minimum number of instances running
        - What: Hands-off way to maintain X number of instances
        - When: I need 3 instances always
      - Manual
        - Use maximum, minimum or specific number of instances
        - What: Manually change desired capacity via console or CLI
        - When: My needs change so rarely that I can just manually add and remove
      - Schedule
        - Increase or Decrease instances based on Schedule
        - What: Adjust min/max instances based on specific times
        - When: Every Monday morning, we get a rush on our website
      - Dynamic
        - Scale based on real-time metrics of the systems
        - What: Scale in response to behavior of elements in the environment
        - When: When CPU Utilisation gets to 70% on current instances, scale up
    - Launch Configurations
      - Template used in Autoscaling group which defines
        - type of EC2 instance
        - Specify VPC and Subnets for scaled instances
      - Attach to a ELB
      - Define a Health Check Grace Period
      - Define size of the group to stay at a initial size
      - Or Use scaling policy which can be based from metrics (CPU, ALB Request Count Per Target, Network Traffic In/Out)
    - Scaling Policies
      - Target Tracking Policy
        - What: Scale based on a predefined or custom metric in relation to a target value
        - When: When CPU Utilisation gets to 70% on current instances, scale up
      - Simple Scaling Policy
        - What: Waits until health check and cool down period expires before evaluating new need
        - When: Let's add new instances slow and steady
      - Step Scaling Policy
        - What: Responds to scaling needs with more sophistication and logic
        - When: AGG! Add ALL instances
    - Scaling Cooldowns
      - Configuration duration that gives scaling a chance to "come up to speed" and absorb load
      - Default cooling period is 300 seconds
      - Automatically applies to dynamic scaling and optionally to manual scaling but not supported for *scheduled scaling*
      - Can override default cooldown via scaling-specific cool down
      - Review examples
  - Kinesis
    - Collection of services for processing streams of various data
    - Data is processed in "shards" - with each shard able to ingest 1000 records per second
    - A default limit of 500 shards, but you can request an increase to unlimited shards
      - Shards allow parallel processing of incoming data.
      - More like lanes in a highway. More lanes, more traffic can pass through.
    - Record consists of Partition Key, Sequence Number and Data Blog (up to 1MB)
    - Transient Data Store - Default Retention of 24 hours, but can be configured for up to 7 days
    - Flavors for Kinesis
      - Kinesis Video Streams
        - Stream the data coming through from various sources, optimised to handle video data.
      - Kinesis Data Streams
        - Stream any data coming through from various sources
      - Kinesis Firehose
        - Receive data coming through from various sources and land it in S3, Redshift, lambda, EC2 instance etc.
      - Kinesis Data Analytics
        - Apply analytics on incoming data immediately.
  - DynamoDB Scaling
    - Divided into two dimensions
      - Throughout
        - Read Capacity Units
        - Write Capacity Units
      - Size
        - Max Item Size 400KB
    - Terminology
      - Partition: A physical space where DynamoDB is stored
      - Partition Key: A unique identifier for each record; sometimes called as a Hash Key
      - Sort Key: In combination wtih the Partition Key, a composite key can be created that defines storage order; Sometimes called as "Range Key"
    - Under the Hood
      - DynamoDB scales by adding partitions.
      - Partition Calculation
        - By Capacity: (Total RCU / 3000) + (Total WCU / 1000)
        - By Size: Total Size / 10 GB
        - Total Partitions: Round Up for MAX (By Capacity, By Size)
        - Example
          - By Capacity: (2000 RCU / 3000) + (2000 WCU / 1000) = 2.66
          - By Size: 10 GB / 10 GB = 1
          - Total Partitions: MAX (2.66,1) = 2.66 Round Up = 3 Partitions
      - Using Target Tracking method to try and stay close to Target Utilisation
      - Currently does not scale down if table's consumption drops to Zero
        - Workaround #1: Send requests to the table unit until it scales down
        - Workaround #2: Manually reduce the max capacity to be the same as min capacity
      - Also supports Global Secondary Indexes - think of them like a copy of the table just indexed or keyed differently
  - CloudFront
    - Can deliver content to users faster by caching static and dynamic content at edge locations
    - Dynamic Content delivery is achieved using HTTP cookies forwarded from your origin
    - Supports Adobe Flash Media Server's RTMP Protocol but have to choose RTMP delivery method
    - Web distributions also support media streaming and live streaming but use HTTP or HTTPS
    - Origins can be S3, EC2, ELB or another web server
    - Multiple origins can be configured
    - User Behaviors to configure serving up origin content based on URL Paths
    - Example: CloudFront CDN can configured to serve static content from a S3 bucket and dynamic content via an ELB which is backended by an EC2 fleet.
    - Invalidation Requests
      - There are several ways to invalidate a CloudFront cache
        - Simply delete the file from the origin and wait for the TTL to expire. TTL is configurable
        - Use the AWS console to request invalidation for all content or a specific path such as /images/*
        - Use the CloudFront API to submit an invalidation request
        - Use Third-party tools to perform CloudFront invalidation (CloudBerry, YLastic, CDN Planet, CloudFront Purge Tool)
    - CloudFront Supports
      - Zone Apex DNS entries (that is without www or any subdomains in front of the URL)
      - Geo Restriction: White List and Black List countries to access the CloudFront content
  - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
    - Enables a Publish/Subscribe design pattern
    - Topics: A channel for publishing a notification, consider this as an outbox
    - Subscription: Configuring an endpoint to receive messages published on the topic
    - Endpoint protocols include HTTP(S), email, SMS, SQS, Amazon Device Messaging (push notifications) and lambda
    - Fan Out Architecture
      - User Uploads an item ->
      - S3 bucket ->
      - SNS ->
      - Image Upload Topic ->
        - SES -> Thank you email
        - SQS -> Image Resize Queue
        - Lambda -> Amazon Rekognition
  - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
    - Reliable, highly-scalable, hosted message queuing service.
    - Available integration with KMS for encrypted messaging.
    - Transient Storage - default 4 days, max 14 days
    - Optionally supports First-in First-out queueing order.
    - Maximum message size of 256KB but by using a special Java SQS SDK, messages can be as large as 2GB.
      - Stores the message on S3 and creates a SQS message as a pointer to the message
    - Significant benefit of SQS is that it helps create Loosely coupled architectures.
    - Standard Queue vs FIFO queue
      - Standard Queue: Order is not guaranteed.
      - FIFO Queue: Order is guaranteed, first in, first out
  - Amazon MQ
    - Managed implementation of Apache's ActiveMQ
    - Fully Managed and highly available within a region
    - Fully supports ActiveMQ API, JMS, NMS, MQTT, WebSocket etc
    - Designed as a drop-in replacement for on-premise message brokers
    - Use SQS if a new application is created from scratch.
    - Use MQ if migrating an existing Message Brokers to AWS
  - Amazon Lambda
    - Allows users to run code on-demand without the need for Infrastructure
    - Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go and C#
    - Code is stateless and executed on a event basis (SNS, SQS, S3, DynamoDB Streams etc)
    - No fundamental limits to scaling a function since AWS dynamically allocates capacity in relation to events
  - Simple Workflow Service (SWF)
    - Create distributed asynchronous systems as workflows
    - Supports both sequential and parallel processing.
    - Tracks the state of the workflow which you interact and update via API
    - Best suited for human-enabled workflows like a order fulfilment or procedural requests
    - AWS recommends new applications - look at Step Functions over SWF
    - Components for SWF
      - Activity Worker
        - A program that interacts with the AWS SWF service to get tasks, process tasks and return results
      - Decider
        - A program that controls coordination of tasks such as their ordering, concurrency and scheduling
  - AWS Step Functions and Batch
    - Managed workflow and orchestration platform
    - Scalable and highly available
    - Define app as a state machine
    - Create tasks, sequential steps, parallel steps, branching paths or timers.
    - Amazon State Language declartive JSON
